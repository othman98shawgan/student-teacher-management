## 📝 Notes

- Backend runs on both `https://localhost:7178` and `http://localhost:5105`.
- Frontend uses Vite and runs on `http://localhost:5173`.
- Role-based access control is implemented using ASP.NET Identity.
- You can customize roles/permissions in `backend/Program.cs` or `Startup.cs`.

## 💡 Tips

- For quick testing, register a teacher and student user and switch roles.
- Add more features like notifications, grading analytics, or file uploads if needed.
